# Air-Purifier-Project
This is a project that we executed during a competition at FPT. We utilized the 'Bridge' feature to connect two ESP 32 boards together, creating this project. The 'Bridge' file is a program used to link the two ESP 32 boards, and the 'Finalr05' file is the main program that operates in the 5th version.
